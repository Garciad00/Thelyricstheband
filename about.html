        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>CIS 155 Daniel Garcia Version 1 07/20/2019</p>
        <p>For my site I used a header, footer, navigation, and div section 
        for my paragraphs.I made my background color black in the html section 
        and changed my font colors to white. I added an id so i could set my 
        options different in my css for the about.html page. I attempted using 
        psuedo code to enable the hover (color change) of my navigation bar and set the links.
        For my layout I used more of a floating elements - i believe that is what it is called.
        I used one image for the index file and put it in the images directory to access it
        I used the footer for a date - could become a copyright sign in the future. 
        Set my font colors with a global setting.</p>   
        <p>CIS 155 Daniel Garcia Version 2 08/10/2019</p>
        <p>For this version of my site I added a background photo on the index page . 
           updated the header. Added a table for the music page to organize and explain 
           a little about the songs. I used some linear gradient and am still experimenting 
           find the right colors I want. I added a table css file to overide the photo, 
           i dont want it on that page, and find a linear blend instead. I still have a lot 
           of work to do on the photo and other page that is gonna take me awhile to complete. 
        </p>
        <p>CIS 155 Daniel Garcia Version 3 08/20/2019</p>
        <p>This update i added a form (survey for viewers) changed the background colors for the entire site.
           I added an iframe and two audio files to the music table. The background colors give it more of a consitant flow. 
           The audio and video add great content. The form enables a window to see what users think and feel about the content
           and the site itself.
